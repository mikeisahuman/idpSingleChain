# Tools
### A small collection of miscellaneous sequence tools that have proven useful.

Based upon 'Sequence' object class.

* 'display_seq' : Uses Matplotlib to make a figure of custom-formatted sequence text. Optional labels and adjustable spacing. Great for making reference tables!
* 'props' : Simple functions for sequence properties, e.g. SCD. Utilizes 'Sequence' only if referring by name (and file), otherwise is self-contained.
* 'MC_seq' : Monte Carlo search for random sequences, optionally with special properties (SCD asymmetry, or within SCD range).
