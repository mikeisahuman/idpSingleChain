## Intrinsically Disordered Protein (IDP) sequence-specific physics theory for a Single Chain

### Consists of two main sectors
1. Mean-square end-to-end distance $\langle R_{ee}^2 \rangle$  
   i.e. overall estimation of chain compaction / swelling (conformation) as a function of sequence and conditions (salt, temperature, pH)
2. Full distance map between any two amino acids / reisdues in the chain $\langle R_{ij}^2 \rangle$  
   i.e. detailed estimation of chain compaction / swelling within each section of the chain, as a function of sequence and conditions (salt, temperature, pH)

### Each has two models of underlying physics
* 'xModel' : Full Ionization model
   - simple assignment of charge +1 / -1 / 0 for each amino acid in the chain, according to their properties
* 'doiModel' : Counter-ion Condensation / degree of ionization / beyond monopole theory
   - ionization of amino acids is determined self-consistently with conformation, accounting for dipole interactions
